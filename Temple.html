            <h4 class="motto">Dogs are the most faithful friends in the world.Different breeds of dogs have different character.Now, let me introduce different varieties of puppies to you.</h4>

                        <div class="caption">
                            <h3>Husky</h3>
                            <p>With its wolfish good looks, a full-grown Husky always has a certain air of distinction.
                             <br/>In poppy form however, the Husky resembles Gizmo's first batch crossed with a cartoon.
                             <br/>The breed's familiar wolf-like facial colorings when miniaturized, give the pups a look of almost evil determination, which combined with their hapless size makes them absolutely precious.
                             <br/>Although hard to housebreak, huskies make up for it with a natural playfulness, a trait they often carry from puppyhood  to maturity.
                             <br/>Quite frankly, they can be crazy energetic, so one should't be surprised to see a Husky puppy bouncing here, there and everywhere in search of adventure and mysterious fun.
                             <br/>They may very well drive the family cat right out of town.

                        <div class="caption">
                            <h3>Dachshund</h3>
                             <p>Cuteness could and should be measured in units of Corgi puppies, because, well, look at them.
                                <br/>Oftentimes, strange can be cute.
                                 <br/>And with their absurdly long bodies and stubby legs, these little hounds are adorably odd, particularly as puppies.
                                 <br/>Also known as a Doxie or more casually the Wiener Dog, Dachshunds can be found in all sorts of colors, with black and tan being the most common.
                                 <br/>They also come in smooth or short, wire and longhair  coats, meaning there's a variety out there to suit most tastes.
                                 <br/>Although a little difficult to housebreak and potentially annoyingly barky, Doxies are hopelessly devoted to their families and play well with older children.
                                 <br/>In all honesty though, the moment this little bundle of joy comes into your life, you won't want to share it with your kids anyway.

                            <h3>Pomeranian</h3>
                            <p>
                                Also called the Zwergspitz or the Loulou, and looking like a cloud crossed with a cotton ball, with a little Ewok thrown in, the Pomeranian is a keen learner and loyal to the core.
                                <br/>Although known for their tiny size and thus, their huge cuteness, the Pomeranian is descended from much larger ancestors — Spitz dogs, which weigh closer to 30 pounds
                                <br/>Sometimes these old genes resurface, resulting in a "throwback pomeranian"— a Pom Pom substantially larger than their 3 to 7 pound average.
                                <br/>Yes, that's the adult weight range.
                                <br/>At 8 weeks, a healthy Pomeranian puppy can weighas little as a pound.
                                <br/>Is your heart melting at the mere thought of one yet?

                            <p>Ah, the Golden Retriever. But which one?
                                <br/>There are actually three main categories: British, American and Canadian, and each one will melt your heart.
                                <br/>Coming in shades from cream to gold and even some reddish hues, a Golden Retriever is a friend for the whole family, not just the person that feeds it.
                                <br/>Third in popularity in the U. S., at least one Golden has found a home in the White House.
                                <br/>President Ford's appropriately named pet Liberty, and why not?
                                <br/>With their wooing good looks and smarts to match, a Retriever can make any house a home.
                                <br/>Lovable, trainable and oh so soft, a Golden Retriever puppy can melt a heart of stone.

                            <p>Cuteness could and should be measured in units of Corgi puppies, because, well, look at them.
                                <br/>Welsh for dwarfed dog, Corgis come in two equally adorable variations: the Pembroke and the Cardigan.
                                <br/>While the slightly larger and more colorful Cardigans is not without its fans, it's the Pembroke that tends to win the popular vote.
                                <br/>The Pembroke has been a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II since she received a Corgi named Susan for her eighteenth birthday.
                                <br/>In addition to being cute as a button from birth right through their golden years, the breed is a  subject of rather endearing folklore.
                                <br/>According to legend, Corgis were the traditional steeds of woodland fairies, and were eventually introduced to humans as a gift.

                            <p>Cuter, smaller and less grumpy looking than their English cousins, the French Bulldog is not a pup to be ignored.
                                <br/>Actually a dog of English heritage, the Bouledogue Francais began as a toy-sized variant of the English Bulldog, and gained its name when it found an easily earned popularity across the Channel .
                                <br/>Known for its stocky build,bat-like ears and droopy upper lip, the Frenchie is a playful, laid-back and loving little creature.
                                <br/>They come in an array of colors, including brindle, white, fawn and black.
                                <br/>Given their size, they are great dogs for apartment dwellers.
                                <br/>Even as adults they are cuter than most puppies, but when they're young... their cute factor is off the charts.
